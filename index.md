## About Me
I am a Business PhD student (Strategic Management) at the University of Torontoâ€™s Rotman School of Management. My research uses experimental, econometric, and machine learning techniques to understand how behavioral and economic factors impact strategic decision making. 

Prior to my PhD, I worked as a Research Associate at Harvard Business School. I hold a BA in Economics from Harvard College. My dissertation advisors are Nicola Lacetera (Chair), Tanjim Hossain, Anita McGahan, and Brian Silverman.

I am on the 2021-2022 job market.
