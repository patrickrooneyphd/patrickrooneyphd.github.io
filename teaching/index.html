<h2>Teaching</h2>
<p>
    I taught Rotman's Core Strategy course for undergrads in Fall 2019 and Summer 2020. In light of the COVID-19
    pandemic, I transitioned the entire Core Strategy course material and teaching team workflow to an online format.
    A sample syllabus can be found <a href="../files/Rooney_RSM392_CommerceStrategy_Summer2020.pdf">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
    I have also worked as a teaching assistant for various graduate courses in Strategy and Economics at the
    University of Toronto and Harvard Business School.
